# Lexical-Variation-Finder-Python

Old Python project to help with my A Level English Language project. The idea was that the bot would analyse how much variation there was in someone's vocabulary, so that I could attempt to measure the increase in variation over time for someone learning English as a second language.

The success of the project was mixed, and may in part have just been an excuse for me to program while in English class, but I did find the experience quite interesting.

While the code feels very rough to me now, the experience using dictionaries and file handling has been of great use to me since.
